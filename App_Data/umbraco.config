    <promoSubtitle><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the first piece of content created with the <strong>new </strong> template!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I've learned so far:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Document Types
<ul>
<li>Essentially they are data structures (I'm guessing represented by generate class object maybe???) with properties.</li>
<li>Properties are data types that represent fields for content creators to fill out.
<ul>
<li>These fields are represented by modules such as rich text editors, image sources etc as form elements for content creators to fill out in the back end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They determine the structure of content to be output with an associated template</li>
<li>Note: Tabs in document types are not tabs in html they're just for organizing the data entry UI into organised tabs to make it easier for content creators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Templates
<ul>
<li>cshtml files that make use of the Document type data structure filled out by content creators.</li>
<li>HTML and razor c# injections. ( can be used with web forms to but that isn't covered in the umbraco documentation since it's depreciated.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content
<ul>
<li>Your reading it now. :P</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CSS and Script files.
<ul>
<li>Copying files into the css and js folders etc in the project root will make them appear in umbraco settings.
<ul>
<li>But only when done via visual studio.
<ul>
<li>Tried just copying the files in explorer and they wouldnt show up..</li>
<li>But in the tutorials for the current umbraco version just copying files across worked completely fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
